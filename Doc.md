# Wild Rides: An End-to-End AWS Web Application

This README provides a step-by-step guide to building the Wild Rides web application, a demonstration project using various AWS services. The application simulates a ride-sharing service, similar to Uber or Lyft, but for unicorns. Users can register, log in, and request unicorn rides using an interactive map.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **AWS Account:** You will need an active AWS account with access to the AWS Management Console.
- **Text Editor or Note-taking Tool:** This will be used for copying and pasting IDs, credentials, and other important information.
- **ArcGIS Account:** An ArcGIS account is required for the mapping functionality. Sign up for a free account at arcgis.com.
- Link : https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html

## Project Overview

The project uses several AWS services, all of which fall under the AWS Free Tier for new accounts. If you are outside the free tier period, the project should cost no more than a dollar. The following services are used:

- **CodeCommit:** AWS's source control system, similar to GitHub, for storing and managing the application code.
- **S3:** Used to store the initial application code provided by AWS.
- **IAM:** For managing user permissions and creating roles for services to interact with each other.
- **CloudShell:** A browser-based command-line interface within the AWS Console.
- **Amplify:** A service for building and hosting web applications. It simplifies the deployment process and offers features like continuous deployment.
- **Cognito:** Provides user authentication functionality, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their accounts.
- **Lambda:** Serverless compute service for running code in response to events. In this project, Lambda functions handle ride requests and interact with the database.
- **DynamoDB:** A NoSQL database used to store ride request data and unicorn details.
- **API Gateway:** Creates and manages APIs for invoking Lambda functions and other backend services.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Setting up the Code Repository

1. **Create a CodeCommit Repository:**
    - Navigate to CodeCommit in the AWS Console.
    - Click "Create repository".
    - Name your repository `wild-rides-site` (or similar) and click "Create".

2. **Configure IAM Permissions:**
    - Open a new tab in the AWS Console and go to IAM.
    - Navigate to "Users" and click on your IAM user.
    - On the "Permissions" tab, click "Add permissions" -> "Attach policies directly".
    - Search for "AWSCodeCommitPowerUser" and select the policy.
    - Click "Next" and then "Add permissions".

3. **Generate Git Credentials:**
    - In your IAM user settings, go to "Security credentials".
    - Scroll down to "HTTPS Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit".
    - Click "Generate credentials" and **securely store the generated username and password**.

4. **Clone the Repository:**
    - Open CloudShell in the AWS Console.
    - Use the following command to clone the repository, replacing `<repository_url>` with the HTTPS URL of your CodeCommit repository:
        
        ```
        git clone <repository_url>
        
        ```
        
    - Enter your generated credentials (Git username and password) when prompted.

5. **Copy Code from S3:**
    - Navigate into the cloned repository directory in CloudShell:
        
        ```
        cd <your_directory_name>
        
        ```
        
    - Execute the following command to copy the code from the AWS-provided S3 bucket. Remember to change the region in the URL if you are not using US West (Oregon):
        
        ```
        aws s3 cp s3://ttt-wildrydes/wildrydes-site ./ --recursive
        ```

6. **Commit and Push the Code:**
    - Add all the copied files to the Git staging area:
        
        ```
        git add .
        
        ```
        
    - Commit the changes:
        
        ```
        git commit -m "Initial commit"
        
        ```
        
    - Provide your Git username and email address when prompted (this is the IAM user, not the Git credentials).
    - Push the changes to the CodeCommit repository:
        
        ```
        git push
        
        ```
        
    - Enter your Git credentials again when prompted.
        - Note if you get an error while using the git push, try this :
            
            ```
            git remote set-url origin <repository_url>
            ```
            
            ```
            #Verify that the remote URL has been updated:
            git remote -v
            
            #The output should have your repository_url as orgin
            ```

## Conclusion

You have now successfully built the Wild Rides web application, demonstrating the power and flexibility of various AWS services. Feel free to explore the code further, experiment with different features, and adapt the project to your own ideas.
